This is my first project I am using git/github for.

George Vs. Saddam is a simple game I am using to learn Godot 4.x.

The idea is to tell the story of the Gulf War with a top down bullet hell game
and comic book styled "cut scenes" between the levels.

Testing a picture:

Testing a commit message with vim.
